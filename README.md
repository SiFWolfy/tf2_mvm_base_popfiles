# tf2_mvm_base_popfiles
A dump of templates from existing .pop that anyone could use.

//
// Hiya.
// The main reason this gist exist, is because someone might just happen to not know how to spawn a certain robot class in MvM
// in order to use it, you could simply copy the code and call it from the WaveSpawn
// well, either that or ask someone else to write the template for you.

// Thanks for Reading
